# 0x0F-function_pointers

## Introduction

This project is an introduction to function pointers in the C programming language. The purpose of the project is to understand how function pointers work and how they can be used in practical programming situations.

## Function Pointers

Function pointers are variables that hold the address of a function. They allow us to pass functions as arguments to other functions, or to call functions dynamically at runtime.

## Files and Functions

The project contains the following files and functions:

- `function_pointers.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `0-print_name.c`: A function that prints a name using a function pointer.
- `1-array_iterator.c`: A function that iterates over an array and performs an action on each element using a function pointer.
- `2-int_index.c`: A function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer.
- `3-calc.h`: Header file containing function prototypes for a simple calculator program.
- `3-op_functions.c`: A file containing the functions used by the calculator program.
- `3-get_op_func.c`: A function that selects the appropriate function to perform a given operation.
